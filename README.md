##### India base ball is my favourite sport

Baseball is a bat-and-ball sport played between ****two teams of nine players*** each, taking turns batting and fielding. The game occurs over the course of several plays, with each play generally beginning when a player on the fielding team, called the pitcher, throws a ball that a player on the ***batting team***, called the batter, tries to hit with a bat.
